The exchange owes about $1.45 billion to its top ten creditors, it said in a court filing on Saturday, without naming them. FTX and its affiliates filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on Nov. 11 in one of the highest-profile crypto blowups, leaving an estimated 1 million customers and other investors facing total losses in the billions of dollars. The crypto exchange said on Saturday it has launched a strategic review of its global assets and is preparing for the sale or reorganization of some businesses.

While worldwide markets seemed to recover during the last couple of weeks, there seems to be no let-up for cryptocurrencies with a never-ending stream of bad news for Bitcoin and crypto investors. Of course, most notably the sudden bankruptcy of FTX (FTT-USD) which has the potential to negatively affect Bitcoin in the near future, and might even trigger a larger crisis. This is not a wholly unprecedented situation. Bitcoin has had its problems in the past, for instance in 2014. Most Bitcoin investors will have likely heard about Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox was a large currency exchange which, at one point, handled about 70% of Bitcoin transactions worldwide. This exchange already experienced some problems with hacks and leaks in the years leading up to 2014, but in February 2014 the firm went bankrupt due to a bug in their software leading to stolen Bitcoin. A company as large as this, handling 70% of worldwide transactions in 2014 might have been an even larger negative event for Bitcoin than the recent FTX downfall. The Mt. Gox\"]"

Philippe Gallay is the boss of TSL, the world\\'s biggest maker of snow shoes. He says orders are off the chart: \"For us, it is quite stressful, but it\\'s a good stress, because we are crumbling under orders, we don\\'t know how we will make it - it\\'s rather a good stress.\" Last month TSL\\'s factory in Annecy took orders for 100,000 pairs. That\\'s three times what it would normally do in a whole year. Gallay has quadrupled his usual workforce, and has the factory running 24/7. But he still has a backlog of 40,000 orders. Over at the ski school, director Gregoire Chavanel has noticed the change: \"We rent equipment at the ski resort, and we have around 100 snowshoes, which usually is enough.

Although the rally in September looked promising, bulls could not gain traction above the 200-day Simple Moving Average. The collapse of FTX could not have come at a worse crucial moment as it erased all the efforts built up over September and delivered a hard reminder to traders: tail risks are there to stay and are not going away anytime soon. Ethereum price has had a very binary path in its history where it was simple to be long and stay long for 2021 and become simply bearish for 2022. Thus far, the easy part, as it becomes very choppy now for both bulls and bears to identify where and when to trade and how. A good, solid, and strict trading plan is vital to surviving this market momentum.\\xa0 Current tail risks are thus crushing ETH price as inflation, the overall performance of the dollar this year and the situation in Ukraine, in addition to the technical from the 55-day and the 200-day SMA as caps on the upside.

       "  'Search Bored Ape Yacht Club hype was in full swing earlier this year as celebrities “aped into” the pricey Ethereum NFT collection. Some have even used their Apes to create products, themed restaurants, live performances, and more. But the buzz has faded amid the crypto bear market, and the price to join the exclusive club has been dropping lower and lower in recent weeks. And a “floor” Bored Ape, like the one that singer Justin Bieber spent $1.3 million worth of ETH to buy in January, now sells for a tiny fraction of that price point. As of this writing, the floor price for the Bored Ape Yacht Club—that is, the price of the cheapest-available NFT listed on a marketplace—is about 58.2 ETH, per data from NFT Price Floor, or about $69,800. On Monday, the floor price dipped below $60,000 for the second time this month, but it ticked back upwards throughout the day on Tuesday. It’s been a rough November for the Bored Apes, as the floor price in USD has fallen 33% since the start of the month.

It might be the next domino in the wake of the FTX meltdown from last week. Several other platforms are moving to similar actions, foremost of which is even the Winklevoss-backed platform Gemini delaying withdrawals on its lending program. Again, the alarm bells are flashing for cryptocurrencies, and the price action perfectly translates that sentiment. Ethereum price is down 1% for the day in early European trading as specifically cryptocurrencies are battered yet again on overnight news that crypto provider Genesis is halting withdrawals. To make matters worse, even the famous and well-known Winklevoss twins, known for their leading role in Bitcoin and Facebook, have cut the withdrawals from their lending program in service provider Gemini. This could spell trouble ahead as the market cap of Gemini is much bigger than FTX.\\xa0 ETH price action technically is in an area that fits the current narrative in cryptocurrencies.

While worldwide markets seemed to recover during the last couple of weeks, there seems to be no let-up for cryptocurrencies with a never-ending stream of bad news for Bitcoin and crypto investors. Of course, most notably the sudden bankruptcy of FTX (FTT-USD) which has the potential to negatively affect Bitcoin in the near future, and might even trigger a larger crisis. This is not a wholly unprecedented situation. Bitcoin has had its problems in the past, for instance in 2014. Most Bitcoin investors will have likely heard about Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox was a large currency exchange which, at one point, handled about 70% of Bitcoin transactions worldwide. This exchange already experienced some problems with hacks and leaks in the years leading up to 2014, but in February 2014 the firm went bankrupt due to a bug in their software leading to stolen Bitcoin. A company as large as this, handling 70% of worldwide transactions in 2014 might have been an even larger negative event for Bitcoin than the recent FTX downfall. The Mt. Gox\",\n",

But all we have is the present and what actually exists on Meta’s platform at the moment.

Meta Horizon posted this tweet this week about an “event” happening inside the Metaverse in which an unseen Godzilla has stepped on…a Wendy’s. In the Wendyverse.

The Meta Quest Pro is a sleek, black headset with a glossy front panel that makes it look more serious and professional than the bulbous, white Quest 2.
